# llms-semantics

Using GPT-2 to generate embeddings of words for different colors. 
* Trying different analysis techniques to see if GPT-2 understands the semantics of colors.

 Conclusion
 * The color embeddings in GPT-2 and RGB coding of colors have 0.86 similarity.
 * This means GPT-2's embeddings align well with color coding in RGB. At least they capture the semantics of color in some aspects.
